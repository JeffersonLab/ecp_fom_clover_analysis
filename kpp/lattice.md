# Science Challenge Problem Description

Six computations are representative of three of the common fermion actions
that USQCD currently uses: (1) the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ)
action, (2) the domain wall fermion (DWF) action, and (3) the Wilson-clover
fermion action. The FOM for each action is determined from two benchmark
components: the generation of a gauge configuration and a typical suite of
measurements performed with that gauge configuration.

* **HISQ**: This benchmark performs the calculations needed to measure meson
  masses and decay constants. The benchmark problem measures the rate of
  generating a new gauge configuration by using an molecular dynamics
  algorithm and the rate of making measurements on the gauge-field
  configuration.
* **DWF**: As with the HISQ action, two FOMs for the DWF component were
  adopted. The first measures the rate at which a current state-of-the-art
  gauge field ensemble can be generated, and the second calculates a suite of
  observable by using this ensemble.
* **Wilson-Clover**: The Clover benchmark has two components. The first is the
  rate at which dynamical Clover fermion lattices can be generated by using a
  molecular dynamics algorithm. Several solutions of the Dirac equation are
  computed and contracted to construct observables as part of the second
  component of the benchmark.

                           with four flavors of highly improved
                           staggered-fermion sea quarks at their physical
                           masses but with degenerate up and down
                           quarks. Specifically, run 4 molecular dynamics time
                           units. Measure a standard set of meson decay

                           on a single lattice.

                           algorithm and sparse matrix
                           solutions. Analysis methods will use multiple
                           right-hand side solvers.

                           spacing of 0.06 fm. Specifically,
                           run 10 trajectories (Monte Carlo time units) to observe
                           the behavior and stability of the algorithm.

Demonstration calculation  A fully equilibrated lattice is needed. This will

                           units. Measurement tests can be done on a single
                           lattice.
